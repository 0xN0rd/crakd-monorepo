      'Every week, a new contest begins for a variety of different games. All you need to do is enter the contest of your choice with the gamertag you use for that game. We do everything else! While you play troughout the week, we will track each game you play. Each match you play will be scored based on the scoring rules for that specific game. Your top 3 match scores for that week determine where you finish on the leaderboard!',

    title: 'Can I Win Real Prizes?',
    description:
      'Yes! Crakd offers 2 different contest formats at this time - Cash and Guaranteed Prize Pools (GPP). Each of these formats payout cash prizes to players on a weekly basis. Cash contests payout prizes to the top 50% of finishers on the leaderboard - each player receiving an even amount of the prize pool. GPP contests payout prizes to the top 20% on a descending scale - the top finisher on the leaderboard takes home the most prize money, while the next places take him a smaller and smaller amount.',

    title: 'How Does Scoring Work?',
    description:
      'We track every game you play during the week for the tournament that you enter. Each game that Crakd offers contests for is scored in their own unique way so be sure to check the rules on each specific tournaments page. However, most games share similar scoring attributes such as receving points for kills, deaths and assists. This is what makes Crakd unique compared to traditional tournaments. You can pop off one or two games during the week and that could mean the difference between finishing out of the money or in the money that week.',

    title: 'How Does The Cash Format Work?',
    description:
      'Cash contests are a great way to consistently win prize money each week. While the prize money you can win is smaller than a GPP contest, your chances of finishing in the money are much higher with the top 50% of participants taking home prizes.',
  },
  {
    title: 'How Does The GPP Format Work?',
    description:
      'Guaranteed Prize Pools, or GPP, separates the sweats from the casuals. This is where the big money can be made. The top player takes home the biggest share of the prize pool, while the rest of the top 20% take home a smaller and smaller amount as you go down the leaderboard. Are you cracked enough to take home the big one?',
